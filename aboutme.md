subtitle: Education, Projects, Interests, and all of that...

My name is Lea Cohausz and I'm a PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/researchers/phd-students/">University of Mannheim</a>. I am notoriously interested in many things which is reflected in pretty much every aspect of my life. 


### Research Interests

- **causal modelling and causal structure learning**
- **causal modelling and fairness**
- Explainability
- combining causal inference and predictive models
- much of the above in the context of Educational Data Mining
- (AI-Planning and Reinforcement Learning for Goal and Plan Recognition)

If you are interested in any of these topics, feel free to reach out to me.



### Education

- since 2021: PhD student at the University of Mannheim (Computer Science)
- 2018-2020: M.Sc. Data Science, University of Mannheim
- 2018-2021: M.A. Sociology, University of Mannheim



### Scholarships 

- 2017-2021: Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes (German Academic Scholarship Foundation)
- 2016-2017: Deutschlandstipendium



### Teaching
I am actively involved in teaching several courses:
- Decision Support: Master-level course on the basics of logic and probability theory, graphical models (in particular BNs), utility theory, game theory, and reinforcement learning
- Industrial Applications of AI (my sessions: agriculture/computer vision and education/XAI/causal modelling and biases): hands-on Master-level course
- Master Team Project and Master Seminar Content Recommendation


### Workshops & Tutorials
I have (co-)organized workshops and tutorials:
- EDM 2024: Tutorial on *Thinking Causally in EDM: A Hands-On Tutorial for Causal Modeling Using DAGs*
- EDM 2024: Workshop on *Human-Centric eXplainable AI in Education (HEXED)* with Juan D. Pinto, Luc Paquette, Vinitra Swamy, Tanja Käser, and Qianhui Liu
- DELFI 2024: Workshop on *Learning Analytics: Study Path and Curriculum Analytics* with Frederik Baucks and Niels Seidel


### Interests Outside Academia

I enjoy being outside, going on hikes, bouldering, sailing, playing all kinds of sports, and being a volunteer firefighter.


### Social Involvement
- volunteer firefighter in Mannheim
- co-organizing the <a href="https://wuman.de/wids/">Women in Data Science Event</a> in Mannheim
- active in the <a href="https://www.cybermentorin.de/index.php/de/">Cybermentorin community</a> which focuses on getting more girls interested in STEM
- currently inactive sports coach
