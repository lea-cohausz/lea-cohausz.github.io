I once again co-organized the <a href="https://hexed-workshop.github.io">HEXED workshop</a> at the EDM conference taking place in Palermo.

Then, I presented two papers at the co-located AIED conference.
The [first one](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-99261-2_2) introduces many of the thoughts and ideas I had/have while working towards my PhD in a structured way and details why I believe causal thinking is very advantageous in Machine Learning (and, in particular, in the application area of education).



The [second one](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-98462-4_14) I presented because my colleague, <a href="https://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/institut/personen_pw/dieing_thilo/thilo_dieing_inhalt.de.jsp">Thilo</a>, with whom I had the pleasure to work on the paper, could not make it to the conference. It presents a survey of how papers introducing educational chaatbots handle problematic, out-of-fomain user questions.
