I once again co-organized the HEXED workshop (https://hexed-workshop.github.io) at the EDM conference taking place in Palermo.

Then I presented two papers at the co-located AIED conference.
The first one introduces many of the thoughts and ideas I had/have while working towards my PhD in a structured way:
Cohausz, L. (2025, July). Why the Future of AIED is Causal: Arguments for Creating a Tradition Based on Causal Thinking. In *International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education* (pp. 17-31). Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland.

The second one I presented because my colleague, Thilo, with whom I had the pleasure to work on the paper, could not make it to the conference:

Dieing, T. I., & Cohausz, L. (2025, July). Whereâ€™s the F*** ing Filter? A Survey on Handling Problematic and Sensitive Questions in Open Educational Chatbots. In *International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education* (pp. 108-115). Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland.
